;Ask yourself
ถามตัวคุณเอง


;Do you feel in control of your personal information online?
คุณรู้สึกว่าสามารถควบคุมข้อมูลส่วนตัวออนไลน์ของคุณได้ไหม?


;Do you know what a cookie is (no, not the delicious kind)?
คุณรู้จักไหมว่าคุกกี้คืออะไร (ไม่ ไม่ใช่อะไรที่อร่อย ๆ)?


;Have you ever wondered why some content, like ads, seems to follow you around?
คุณเคยสงสัยไหมว่าทำไมเนื้อหาบางอย่าง เช่น โฆษณา เหมือนกับว่าจะตามคุณอยู่?


;What is tracking?
ิอะไรคือการติดตาม?


;Every time we go online, we leave behind traces of our activity. They’re often called our “digital footprints” and for good reason, because tracking is sort of like re-tracing our steps.

;Let’s imagine a typical day online: you start by checking emails, maybe share a fun article you just read.
ลองจินตนาการแต่ละวันที่คุณออนไลน์: คุณเริ่มต้นด้วยการตรวจสอบอีเมล บางครั้งอาจแบ่งปันบทความสนุก ๆ ที่คุณเพิ่งอ่าน


;At lunch, you check showtimes for a movie a friend recommended on Facebook and look up prices for some new camping gear you’ve had your eye on.
ช่วงทานข้าว คุณตรวจสอบเวลาฉายภาพยนตร์ที่เพื่อนคุณแนะนำมาบน Facebook และดูราคาสำหรับอุปกรณ์ใช้งานในค่ายที่คุณกำลังมองหา


;That’s only a few sites, but what’s happening behind the scenes is that many more “third-parties” — companies that are separate from the sites you’re visiting — are seeing and recording your activity.
นั่นเป็นเพียงไม่กี่เว็บ แต่สิ่งที่เกิดขึ้นเบื้องหลังนั่นคือมีบุคคลที่สามมากมาย บริษัทที่แตกต่างกันจากเว็บที่คุณกำลังเยี่ยมชม กำลังมองและบันทึกกิจกรรมของคุณ


;So when you begin seeing recommended articles about that movie, or ads for that camping gear, later in the day, it’s no coincidence.
ดังนั้น เมื่อคุณเริ่มเห็นการแนะนำบทความเกี่ยวกับภาพยนตร์ หรือโฆษณาเกี่ยวกับอุปกรณ์ใช้งานในค่ายในวันหลัง ๆ มันไม่ใช่เหตุการณ์บังเอิญ
